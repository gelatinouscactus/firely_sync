This is a WIP/learning experience for my. It is my attempt to create a customizable simulation of the synchronization of pulsing fireflies. I am using it as a basis to learn more python, PyQt5, and git/github to keep track of progress. If you have any suggestions/constructive criticisms etc, please let me know!

Project Goals:
Using python and PyQt5, create a gui interface to initialize a graphics simulation of fireflies synchronizing their flashes. There are already some similar implementations of this in various forms (todo: add links) however I will be attempting it from scratch with very minial reference to these sources except for the very brief research.

Simulation features:
fireflies will be moving, though some may be stationary
fireflies flashing frequency and phase will sync
fireflies flashing duration and amplitude will sync
	  - possibly color as well.

once completely synced, there will be some chance/mechanism for the synchronization to decay and the flashes to fall back into chaos for a time, before resyncing.

NOTE: this is not meant to be a physically true simulation of firefly flashes. I am merely taking inspiration from the idea and hoping to make something that is customizable and interesting to watch.


TODO:
flesh out the details of the simulation\n\t
      - add algorithm details for the synchronization\n
update readme to reflect all of those details\n
figure out a design path and short term goals\n
basically everything, except the minimal PyQt research/learning I have done


learn how to format readme to make it actually readable
